""" FUNCTION COMPOSITION """

# calling one function within another

# write a function that takes two points, the center of a circle and a point on the perimeter
# and computes the area of a circle 

# (xc, yc) - center points 
# (xp, yp) - perimeter points 

radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)

# find the area of a circle with that radius and return it 
result = area(radius)

# wrapping up function 
# calls two previous functions, distance and area 
def area2(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    result = area(radius)

# temporary variables, radius and result are good for debugging, developing and single-stepping

# once we know it works, make it more concise:
def area2(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))
